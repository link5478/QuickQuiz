Time lock on quiz:- So user can't open quiz and look up answers, then answer quiz. (not priority) - Can't be done on DB end,
if time ask Josh?

Make functions more Robust. Maybe reduce number of Stored Procedures?

With regards to Staff detailed Results. Maybe have a seperate Page they can choose these options from, as well as when they
press a quiz they can select to see the results for that specific quiz. 


CREATE VIEW StaffDetailResult AS
SELECT DISTINCT
q.ID AS 'Quiz ID',
q.NAME AS 'Quiz Name',
qu.QUESTIONNO AS 'Question Number'
FROM ANSWER a, RESULT r, QUIZ q, QUESTION qu
WHERE q.ID = r.QUIZID
AND a.RESULTID = r.ID
AND a.QUESTIONNO = qu.QUESTIONNO
ORDER BY q.ID, qu.QUESTIONNO ASC;















SUM(CASE WHEN a.ANSWER = '1' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS 'Answer 1',
SUM(CASE WHEN a.ANSWER = '2' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS 'Answer 2',
SUM(CASE WHEN a.ANSWER = '3' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS 'Answer 3',
SUM(CASE WHEN a.ANSWER = '4' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS 'Answer 4'
